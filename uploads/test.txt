This is a test document to verify the RAG system functionality.

Section 1: Introduction
This document contains multiple sections to test the chunking and retrieval capabilities of our RAG system.

Section 2: Key Features
- Document chunking with overlap
- Semantic search using embeddings
- Conversation memory
- Source attribution
- Confidence scoring

Section 3: Technical Details
The system uses ChromaDB for vector storage and Ollama for text generation. Documents are processed in chunks with appropriate overlap to maintain context.
