The Amazon Rainforest is the world's largest tropical rainforest, covering much of northwestern Brazil.
It spans approximately 5.5 million square kilometers and is often referred to as the "Earth's lungs" because it produces about 20% of the world's oxygen.

The deepest part of the ocean is the Mariana Trench, located in the western Pacific Ocean.
It reaches a depth of approximately 11,034 meters (36,201 feet) at its deepest point, known as the Challenger Deep.
